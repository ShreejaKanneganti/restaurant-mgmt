# What is this project?

My web application is an online food ordering service. A user can register on the website and log in to the website.
As soon as they log in they can view the Home page where there are details about the restaurant, and menu and can also leave a review.
When they click on the About us page they can view the location of the restaurant and find contacts of the people responsible for managing the restaurant.
On the menu page, they can view the food items available and add the food items to the cart. The add to cart shows the food items selected, it also allows the users to delete the food items if they change their mind, they can also view the total amount that costs them.
